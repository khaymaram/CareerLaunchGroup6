# CareerLaunchGroup6

Group Members: Sarayu Jilludumudi, Khaymar Moe, Anushka Varde

This Career Launch Project is a prototype of a "DormEats" website which will allow users to be matched with easy recipes from ingredients they have in their fridge. 
We plan to format it in a way so that users can simply tick off ingredients they have and be matched with the most feasible recipe.
